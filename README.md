###Instructions
You start with an empty grid that is X by Y (make it configurable). Tell the player to get
ready, then highlight a number of cells (also configurable) for a few seconds while telling
the user to memorize those cells. The game then goes into “Recall” mode, where the
user is challenged to remember those cells after we clear the cells from the grid. If they
guess a correct cell, mark it green, and if they guess a wrong cell, mark it red. They win
if they guess all the right cells with a maximum of two wrong attempts.
